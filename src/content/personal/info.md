name: "Hendrix Roa"
bio: |
  My 10-year career in software engineering has been a journey of accumulating deep, cross-functional expertise, now converging on AI Engineering.
  <br/><br/>
  Each phase was a small step, building the holistic perspective and technical knowledge essential for developing AI solutions. My initial incursion into full-stack and backend development (PHP, Python, Node.js, Java, C#) provided a robust understanding of software fundamentals. However, it was my evolution into roles demanding a holistic architectural view guided by international experience and a focus on sustainable, clean code, cohesion, and small coupling.<br/><br/>
  The subsequent transition into DevOps automation (Terraform, AWS CDK, CDK8s) was driven by a desire to see code perform optimally in production. This phase equipped me with skills in building reliable, scalable, and deployable systems using distributed systems principles directly transferable to architecting and deploying robust AI models and pipelines. Managing legacy systems and tackling technical debt further honed my ability to optimize and innovate within existing infrastructures. This comprehensive journey, from crafting individual components to orchestrating entire production environments, has uniquely prepared me for AI Engineering.  <br/><br/>
  My decade of experience isn't just a collection of roles; it's a curated skill set perfectly aligned with the demands of AI. I am actively seeking an AI Engineering role where I can leverage my decade of experience in building scalable, reliable software systems and my passion for automation to develop and deploy impactful AI solutions. Suppose your organization values a pragmatic, experienced engineer who can bridge the gap between foundational software architecture and cutting-edge AI. In that case, I am eager to connect and explore how I can contribute to your vision.
