This role focused on designing and implementing scalable, efficient infrastructure solutions, emphasizing IaC, GitOps, and cloud services, which are core to MLOps and managing AI infrastructure.

* **MLOps & Infrastructure Automation:**
    * Created and maintained Terraform modules to automate deliverable artifact deployment, enabling a 200% increase in deployment frequency by integrating with AWS services like ECS and CodeBuild. This is directly applicable to automating AI model deployment pipelines.
    * Designed and implemented a GitOps-driven CI/CD pipeline using ArgoCD and Kubernetes, automating the deployment and management of containerized applications, a key practice in MLOps for managing AI application lifecycles.
    * Optimized Docker artifact security by employing Linux Alpine-based images and filtering vulnerable packages, achieving a 60% reduction in vulnerabilities and aligning with OWASP Top 10 guidelines. This is vital for securing AI models and their dependencies.
    * Implemented a robust CI/CD process for monorepo artifacts, leveraging Docker and Jfrog for artifact management, which reduced production errors by 30%, ensuring higher-quality AI model deployments.

* **Scalable & Secure Cloud Solutions for AI:**
    * Configured AWS SQS and AWS Lambda to create an event-driven, asynchronous processing architecture, enhancing scalability and system responsiveness. This pattern is often used in AI for scalable data processing and model inference.
    * Implemented AWS Single Sign-On (SSO) across multiple AWS accounts, centralizing user authentication and simplifying access control for cloud resources, critical for securing access to AI development and production environments.
    * Developed a nightly monitoring job integrating with JIRA REST API to detect and notify security leaks, resulting in an 80% reduction in overall vulnerabilities, important for maintaining the security of AI systems and data.

* **Collaboration & Best Practices for AI Teams:**
    * Implemented comprehensive Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) and flow diagrams to document internal processes, enhancing stakeholder understanding and streamlining onboarding, vital for clear communication in AI projects.
