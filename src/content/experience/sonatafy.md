This role involved enhancing backend services for a large-scale streaming platform, emphasizing robust integrations, optimized task handling, and DevOps practices, all of which are foundational for AI engineering, particularly in MLOps and data-intensive AI applications.

* Data Pipeline & Processing for AI/ML:
    * Designed and integrated a video processing pipeline using Nest.js and an ETL process with MongoDB, increasing processing capacity from 2K to 5K assets per day through Quickplay API integration. This demonstrates experience in building scalable data pipelines crucial for ingesting and preparing data for AI models.
    * Developed a Fastify-based scheduler backend enabling the content team to schedule live sports events using GCP Tasks, reliably supporting over 5 million active users. This showcases skills in building real-time systems capable of handling large data streams and user loads, relevant for live AI applications.
    * Enhanced a live event capture pipeline for reliable recording and storage in GCP Storage, achieving a 99% capture rate. This is akin to ensuring robust data collection for training AI models.
    * Migrated legacy SQL data pipelines to a flexible NoSQL (MongoDB) architecture, significantly enhancing data processing flexibility and team productivity for data-driven features.
    * Designed and implemented a MongoDB database for event metadata, applying performance optimizations that reduced data fetching latency by 40%, critical for efficient data access in AI systems.

* MLOps & System Scalability:
    * Restructured GCP task queues, introducing retry logic and validation layers to minimize message loss and task duplication (decreasing task error rates by 30%), skills transferable to building resilient data processing and inference pipelines in AI. 
    * Built a notification system using GitHub Actions and the Slack API, improving team visibility into production changes and deployment health, aligning with MLOps principles for monitoring and CI/CD.  
    * Led an initiative to improve codebase quality by prioritizing unit testing and adopting TDD techniques (Jest, Mocha, Chai), resulting in a measurable reduction in production bugs, fostering a culture of quality essential for reliable AI systems. 
    * Developed high-performance GraphQL APIs with NestJS and Apollo, reducing client data over-fetching by 40% and improving query response times by 30%, relevant for efficient data interaction with AI models.

* Collaboration & Best Practices:
    * Implemented Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) to document feature specifications and technical decisions, streamlining onboarding and accelerating feature development, showcasing strong communication and documentation skills vital in collaborative AI projects.
