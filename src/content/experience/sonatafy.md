As Back-end Lead, you modernized legacy systems and implemented new integrations for complex financial operations, focusing on automation, scalability, and robust API design.

* **Data Engineering & AI System Integration:**
    * Designed and implemented a RESTful backend architecture from scratch using Nest.js for managing financial records, storing data in Oracle DB, and integrating with Microsoft Business Central API. This reduced report generation time by 50% and enhanced data accuracy for 25 weekly reports, demonstrating skills in building data-centric applications.
    * Implemented an event-driven design for the REST API using a Redis-based queue, enabling real-time monitoring of financial statements. This reduced processing errors by 30% and improved system uptime to 99.9%, skills applicable to real-time AI model monitoring and data processing.
    * Designed a MongoDB data structure to archive historical processing data and extract pipeline performance metrics, automating bi-weekly email reports. This improved data processing speeds by 25% and ensured accurate reporting for over 10,000 daily transactions, relevant for MLOps and data pipeline analytics.
    * Replaced a legacy Salesforce data loader with a Python-based solution using Salesforce REST APIs. This upgrade reduced data load errors by 40%, improved processing time by 30%, and streamlined integration, showcasing Python proficiency for data tasks.

* **Architectural Design & Performance for AI:**
    * Proposed and led the refactoring of legacy batch processing, improving data handling and execution times through optimized queries and memory-efficient designs, particularly in Oracle DB, crucial for efficient AI model training and batch inference.
    * Created APIs that enabled a frictionless mobile experience, allowing seamless communication with backend services, translatable to building APIs for AI model consumption.

* **Leadership & Documentation:**
    * Created technical diagrams and architecture documents using Microsoft Visio, detailing integration flows and system components to support maintainability and cross-team collaboration, demonstrating essential documentation skills for complex AI projects.
